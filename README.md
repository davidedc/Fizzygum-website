If you want to download a pre-made build of Fizzygum, you can find one at https://github.com/davidedc/Fizzygum/releases

There is not much point starring this repo or forking it. Follow the Fizzygum repo instead, or subscribe to the Fizzygum.org feed.

This site is made by combining a fork of the "minimal mistakes" Jekyll theme AND a Fizzygum build, via the two scripts ```copy-site-from-mmistakes-fork.sh``` and ```get-latest-fizzygum-build.sh```
