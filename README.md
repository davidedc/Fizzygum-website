this repo only contains the website http://fizzygum.org

If you want to download a pre-made build of Fizzygum, you can find one at https://github.com/davidedc/Fizzygum/releases

There is not much point starring this repo or forking it. Follow the Fizzygum repo instead, or subscribe to the Fizzygum.org feed.

This repo/site is made by combining parts of two other repos:
 - the repo that is a fork of the "minimal mistakes" Jekyll theme AND
 - a Fizzygum build

 This is done via the two scripts ```copy-site-from-mmistakes-fork.sh``` and ```get-latest-fizzygum-build.sh``` respectively.

 The reason why we combine two repos into a third one is because I want to keep the "minimal mistakes" fork clean from the Fizzygum build (the Fizzygum build seems out of place in a fork of a Jekill theme).
