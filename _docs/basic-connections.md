Fizzygum lets you connect (or “patch") widgets together to build useful tools.

Before we look into an advanced example we’ll see a couple of simple connections.

In the first example we’ll connect a slider to a textbox.

Let’s open the “patch programming” area:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/basic-connections/basic-connections-1.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

The starting area has a toolbar and the “editing pencil” is highlighted. If you click it, the toolbar is hidden, for less clutter and easier reading:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/basic-connections/basic-connections-2.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

click again now so we can use the toolbar:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/basic-connections/basic-connections-3.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

we pick a slider:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/basic-connections/basic-connections-4.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

we pick a textbox:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/basic-connections/basic-connections-5.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

Now, to connect the slider to the textbox, the slider must be somewhat over the textbox:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/basic-connections/basic-connections-6.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

we connect them using the menu of the slider… connect to… then we pick the textbox… then we choose what to control, in this case we want to control the text content so we pick “text":

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/basic-connections/basic-connections-7.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

and voilà.

Now just another example, we can connect the textbox to a second slider, like so:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/basic-connections/basic-connections-8.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

That’s it for simple connections, in another video we’ll create a useful tool that will convert between two temperature scales: celsius and fahrenheit
