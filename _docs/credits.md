Fizzygum was started from [**Morphic.js**](https://github.com/jmoenig/morphic.js/) by [Jens MÃ¶nig](https://github.com/jmoenig) in October 2012 (followed by independent rework of existing parts and new extensions) and it carries similarities in terms of visual appearance and parts of the underlying structure. The main differences with Morphic.js are listed [here](/docs/differences-with-morphicjs/).

The website is based on the [minimal mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) Jekyll theme by [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes).
