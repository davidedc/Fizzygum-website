## Transcript

"Draw" is one of the sample apps in Fizzygum.

To open it, double click on the paint bucket:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/draw-app/draw-app-1.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

The window has a toolbar and the “editing pencil” is highlighted. When clicked, the toolbar is hidden, for less clutter:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/draw-app/draw-app-2.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

Click again to use the toolbar:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/draw-app/draw-app-3.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

You can use it as a traditional drawing application:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/draw-app/draw-app-4.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

The Draw app accepts any drop, and the dropped items will leave a stamp:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/draw-app/draw-app-5.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

That’s it for the “draw" app, check out the other documents to see how to easily customise what the drawing tools do.
