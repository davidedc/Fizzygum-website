## Transcript

Fizzygum is a new web framework, an entire platform really, designed from the ground up to do complex things easily. Things like: live documents, complex apps, complex sets of apps, or even entire custom environments.

Get the power of an entire Operating System at your fingertips:

...make dashboards and visualise data (plots, maps, ...):

</figure>

author, organise and navigate documents (drawings / text docs / slides):

</figure>

</figure>

</figure>

embed live graphs, dynamic calculations or even entire running programs inside any document, via simple drag & drop:

</figure>

go beyond traditional embedding: you can now infinitely nest and compose programs and documents:

</figure>

make custom utilities (e.g. temperature converter) by simply connecting existing components - no coding required:

  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/intro/intro-7.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

use the internal development tools to create entirely new apps, or change existing ones while they are running. Add custom features without even needing to refresh the page:

</figure>

... and do all of the above, concurrently.

Check the other documents to see examples and details.
