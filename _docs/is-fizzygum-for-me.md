Here is a longer definition of what Fizzygum is good at:

Fizzygum helps you implement _authoring tools_ and _complex_ apps where _several workflows and use cases_ of _diverse_ nature can run and _interact_, _concurrently_.
{: .notice--info}

A great indication of whether Fizzygum is for you is to check how many italic keywords above hit your requirements.

Some **well-matched domains-of-use** are provided in the examples:
 * dashboards creation
 * "live" reports with on-the-fly interactive calculations
 * workflow creation (as in: a flow of data between widgets, like in the temperature converter example)
 * interactive, mixed media authoring and presentation

**Also Fizzygum might be for you** if you have one or more of these needs:
 * you need several visualisations/processes running concurrently
 * the user should to be able to _navigate_, _inspect_ or _dig into_ data
 * you expect the user to connect intermediate results together to create end results
 * you think multiple windows would help

As examples of famous multi-use-case, complex web-apps that use multiple windows, think of the Gmail web interface (desktop) or the Facebook web interface (again desktop).  
Both support multiple contexts of editing, several menus, contacts, contacts activity, chat, and many more use cases.  
Facebook uses docked windows, and Gmail even uses overlapping windows in some editing flows. In both cases the environments facilitate interaction between use cases (e.g. user searches her feed, then copies link from feed into chat window).

Without meaning to limit the potential of use of Fizzygum, we nonetheless also list here examples where we think that Fizzygum might be of limited help:
 * a clock app (single use case, no authoring, no workflows, no interaction between use cases)
 * to-do list (single use case, no workflows, no interaction between use cases)
 * static non-interactive web page (single use case, no dynamic authoring, no workflows, no interaction between use cases, perfectly and completely covered by other solutions)
 * small-screen experiences in general (as they are often: single use case, no dynamic authoring, no workflows, no interaction between use cases)
