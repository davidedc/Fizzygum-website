The fleshed-out definition of what Fizzygum is good at is the following:

Fizzygum is a _flexible_ framework to help you implement _authoring tools_ and _complex_ apps where _several workflows and use cases_ of _disparate_ nature can run and _interact_, _concurrently_.
{: .notice--info}

A great indication of whether Fizzygum is for you is to check how many italic keywords above hit your requirements.

Some **well-matched domains-of-use** are provided in the examples:
 * dashboard creation
 * "live" reports with on-the-fly interactive calculations
 * workflow creation (e.g. temperature converter)
 * interactive, mixed media authoring and presentation

**Also Fizzygum might be for you** if you have one or more of the following needs:
 * you need several running processes in your interface
 * you expect the user to be able to navigate data or inspect / dig into data
 * you expect the user to connect intermediate results together to create end results
 * you think multiple windows would help

As examples of famous multi-use-case, complex web-apps that use multiple windows, think of the Gmail web interface (desktop) or the Facebook web interface (desktop). Both support multiple contexts of editing, several menus, contacts, contacts activity, chat, and many more use cases.  
Facebook uses docked windows, and Gmail even uses overlapping windows in some editing flows. In both cases the environments facilitate interaction between use cases (e.g. user searches its feed, then copies link from feed into chat window).

Without meaning to limit the potential of use of Fizzygum, we nonetheless also briefly mention cases where we think that Fizzygum might be of limited help:
 * a clock app (single use case, no authoring, no workflows, no interaction between use cases)
 * to-do list (single use case, no workflows, no interaction between use cases)
 * static non-interactive web page (single use case, no dynamic authoring, no workflows, no interaction between use cases, perfectly and completely covered by other solutions)
 * small-screen experiences in general (as they are often: single use case, no dynamic authoring, no workflows, no interaction between use cases)
