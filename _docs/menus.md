## Transcript

Fizzygum lets you control the properties of pretty much anything via menus.

We’ll look at the menu for a map, but most of this applies to any other widget, group of widgets, connected widgets and whole apps.

To open the menu, either right-click on the widget, or long-tap on it:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/menus/menus-1.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

The very first trick with menus is that you can move them and pin them down by moving/clicking on the bar at the top:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/menus/menus-2.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

Just drag them to the basement to get rid of them:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/menus/menus-3.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>


“color" and “transparency” let you change color and transparency:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/menus/menus-4.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/menus/menus-5.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

"resize/move" gives handles to resize and move the widget:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/menus/menus-6.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

"Duplicate” is quite powerful, it creates a copy of the widget (or group of widgets):

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/menus/menus-7.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

Note that the copy of connected widgets remains connected, and the copy is independent from the original. Also, "running" widgets can be duplicated just fine:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/menus/menus-8.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

“create shortcut” creates a new shortcut on the desktop, which can be put in a folder for example:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/menus/menus-9.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

“pick up” is another way to drag widgets:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/menus/menus-10.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

“locking” prevents the widgets from being dragged:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/menus/menus-11.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

“delete” puts the widget in the basement, where it might be recycled:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/menus/menus-12.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

the “dev” submenu gives access to the internals and source code of the widget (for more details see the dedicated doc):

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/menus/menus-13.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

Menus are _really_ powerful tools, they come handy all the times and they’ll come up again and again in the other docs.
