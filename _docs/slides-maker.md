## Transcript

The slides maker is one of the sample apps in Fizzygum.

To open it, double click on the slide icon:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/slides-maker/slides-maker-1.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

The starting slide has a toolbar and the “editing pencil” is highlighted. When clicked, the toolbar is hidden, for less clutter and easier reading:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/slides-maker/slides-maker-2.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

Just click again to use the toolbar, drag anything out of it and put it in place:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/slides-maker/slides-maker-3.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

You can resize any item by right-clicking on it, choosing the item you want to resize, and choosing “resize/move” from the menu:

  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/slides-maker/slides-maker-4.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

You can change many properties of any item in the same way, for example the color of this map:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/slides-maker/slides-maker-5.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

Once any item is added, the slide will lock its proportions, so when the slide is resized all the items will keep their relative positions:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/slides-maker/slides-maker-6.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

Let’s add a link now:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/slides-maker/slides-maker-7.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>

And finally, you can drop anything in the slides maker, try with the clock for example:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/docs-gifs/slides-maker/slides-maker-8.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="1">
</figure>
