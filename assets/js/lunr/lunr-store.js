We really want to convert F to C as well, so let’s just connect the widgets all the way around… we’ll have to use another formula box from F to C   and then the second formula box back to the first slider:   We connected the widgets in a cycle, however this is not a problem, as the system knows when to stop calculating things around… now note how all the  widgets are aligned to the correct values, whichever widget we change:   So we’ve seen a more advanced example of connecting or “patching” widgets, a really powerful way to build complex tools.

To remove an item just drop it in the basement:   The items dropped in the document keep the relative size in respect to the page. So, to make items take the full with of the page, just make sure that they are as large or larger than the page when they are dropped:   The items normally get bigger as the page is made larger. However the “layout in stack” menu lets you change the elasticity, and whether the items sit left, right or centered in the page:   And finally, anything can be dropped in the document, let’s try with the clock for example:   That was it for the document maker, check out the other documents for more examples of use, such as documents with interactive graphs.

        "title": "Hacking Fizzygum",
        "excerpt":"  Transcript Fizzygum lets you directly access and change the source code of any of its parts, which is very powerful to let you customise it, let’s see two examples. In the first example we are going to change what the drawing tools in the “Draw” app do. Just open the draw app first:   and click on the little pencil here:   and try for example to change the color of the brush… It might take a while to find your way around the first time however… let’s try this:   OK Done. Now, in this first example the way to change code was offered explicitly by the drawing app, the drawing tools’ buttons were special and they provided a dedicated way to change how they work. In general though apps and buttons don’t offer this explicit way of editing their source. However there is an equally powerful and more general way that lets you edit any piece of source code of Fizzygum. Let’s do something simple, let’s say that we want to make the seconds hand of the clock more prominent (because maybe we are using the clock to count seconds or something like that). … let’s make a copy first:   Now let’s open the menu for the clock widget and go in dev… and then “inspect”:   In this list we get the functions (or methods) in this widget, and it looks like this one is the one we want, hopefully we can find a way to make the seconds hand thicker:   now that’s great, we changed this particular clock, however it could be useful to have a way to change all the existing and future clocks rather than just one. To do that, instead of changing a particular clock we change the blueprint for all the clocks, also known as the “class”. Just click the “AnalogClockWdgt” in the “hierarchy” section to open a Class inspector (as opposed to the object inspector of before):   And let’s change the thickness of the hours hand this time.   OK it worked. Note that all the clocks have changed, and in fact any future clock will be created this way as well. This is just a taste of what you can do by having access to the source code, but there are really no limits, you could change what buttons do, how graphs are drawn, customise workflows et cetera et cetera. That was it for our hacking session, keep an eye on further videos/docs for more examples. ","categories": [],

We’ll look at the menu for a map, but most of this applies to any other widget, group of widgets, connected widgets and whole apps. To open the menu, either right-click on the widget, or long-tap on it:   The very first trick with menus is that you can move them and pin them down by moving/clicking on the bar at the top:   Just drag them to the basement to get rid of them:   “color” and “transparency” let you change color and transparency:     “resize/move” gives handles to resize and move the widget:   “Duplicate” is quite powerful, it creates a copy of the widget (or group of widgets):   Note that the copy of connected widgets remains connected, and the copy is independent from the original. Also, “running” widgets can be duplicated just fine:   “create shortcut” creates a new shortcut on the desktop, which can be put in a folder for example:   “pick up” is another way to drag widgets:   “locking” prevents the widgets from being dragged:   “delete” puts the widget in the basement, where it might be recycled:   the “dev” submenu gives access to the internals and source code of the widget (for more details see the dedicated doc):   Menus are really powerful tools, they come handy all the times and they’ll come up again and again in the other docs.

However Fizzygum also allows to compose these widgets/documents/tools in powerful ways. As our first example let’s connect a slider to a 3d graph, and put them inside a document. Now, we’ve seen the slider in the “patch programming” area, and the 3d graph in the “dashboards” area. However this distinction of areas is really not important, it’s just for convenience, really we can place and connect widgets anywhere, including the desktop To pick any widget we can use the “super toolbar”, which includes the functionality of all the other toolbars:   …so we connect the slider to the example graph, the slider here just changes the data in the graph:   Now we could drop these connected widgets into a document directly, however let’s put them into a generic panel first (“Generic panel”s are similar to slides but have no toolbars of their own):   Now let’s put this panel inside a document. Let’s create the document first:   Note that to put a window inside another one we first need to make it internal - otherwise windows would just be dropped around all the times. This is the icon to do exactly that, indicating that the window can now be dropped inside other windows. Notice how the window becomes of lighter color:   Let’s drop the generic panel with the graph inside the document:   Now let’s say we want to go for a more creative layout, so we put the document inside a slide. Remember to make the window internal.   Let’s add a drawing to the slide too - again let’s make the window with the drawing an internal one.   Job done! ","categories": [],

To open it, double click on the slide icon:   The starting slide has a toolbar and the “editing pencil” is highlighted. When clicked, the toolbar is hidden, for less clutter and easier reading:   Just click again to use the toolbar, drag anything out of it and put it in place:   You can resize any item by right-clicking on it, choosing the item you want to resize, and choosing “resize/move” from the menu:   You can change many properties of any item in the same way, for example the color of this map:   Once any item is added, the slide will lock its proportions, so when the slide is resized all the items will keep their relative positions:   Let’s add a link now:   And finally, you can drop anything in the slides maker, try with the clock for example:   That’s it for the slides maker, make sure to check out other videos to see more examples of use such as embedding interactive graphs.

It was bred as an interior sentinel in the Buddhist monasteries, to alert the monks to any intruders who entered. Lhasa is the capital city of Tibet, and apso is a word in the Tibetan language meaning “bearded”, so, Lhasa Apso simply means “long-haired Lhasa dog”. There are, however, some who claim that the word “apso” is a form of the Tibetan word “rapso”, meaning “goat-like”, which would make the equivalent translation “wooly Lhasa dog”.

Tabbies are sometimes erroneously assumed to be a cat breed. In fact, the tabby pattern is found in many breeds, as well as among the general mixed-breed population.

The following YAML Front Matter has also be applied: excerpt_separator: \"&lt;!--more--&gt;\"If you could keep awake (but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on. I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still. Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more. Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights. Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance. ","categories": ["Post Formats"],

        "excerpt":"This post has reading time disabled. The estimated time that it takes to read this post should not be showing if read_time: false is set in _config.yml or in this post’s YAML Front Matter. If you could keep awake (but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on. I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still. Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more. Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights. Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance. ","categories": [],

You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on. I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still. Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more. Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights. Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance. ","categories": [],

Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me. Left Align This is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it’s views. It’s favorite color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment. Center Align This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes. Right Align This is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it’s views. It’s prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it’s a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss. Justify Align This is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it’s place and not all cattywampus like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of an elitist attitude. ","categories": ["Markup"],

        "title": "Gemified Theme -- Alpha Release",
        "excerpt":"Jekyll themes distributed as Ruby gems are finally here to make installing and upgrading much easier. Gone are the days of forking a repo just to “install it”. Or dealing with merge conflicts when pulling in upstream commits to “upgrade it”. If you’re interested in testing out Minimal Mistakes as a gemified theme read on. There are a few caveats though:   Support for a theme assets folder was recently added to Jekyll core, but has yet to be released or rolled into the github-pages gem. Meaning you can’t use Minimal Mistakes as a Ruby gem there just yet… locally served or self-hosted installs should be fine if you don’t mind using a pre-release version of Jekyll.  Windows users can’t currently use themes packaged as gems due to a bug with file paths in Jekyll core. This is being worked on so hopefully a fix is on the way soon.Fine with all that? Great. Let’s continue. If you’re migrating a site already using Minimal Mistakes and haven’t customized any of the _includes, _layouts, _sass partials, or assets this should be quick and painless. Step 1: Remove Theme Files Remove _includes, _layouts, _sass, assets folders and files within. You won’t need these anymore as they’re bundled in the theme. If you customized any of these then leave them alone and only remove the untouched ones. If setup correctly your modified versions should act as overrides to the versions bundled with the theme. Step 2: Update Gemfile In order to test you’ll need to install pre-release gems of Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes. Start by replacing gem \"github-pages\" or gem \"jekyll\" with the following: gem \"jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git\"Then add the pre-release Minimal Mistakes theme gem: gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch =&gt; \"feature/theme-gem\"`When finished your Gemfile should look something like this: source \"https://rubygems.org\"gem \"jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git\"gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch =&gt; \"feature/theme-gem\"group :jekyll_plugins do  # gem \"jekyll-archives\"  gem \"jekyll-paginate\"  gem \"jekyll-sitemap\"  gem \"jekyll-gist\"  gem \"jekyll-feed\"  gem \"jemoji\"endStep 3: Run Bundler Run bundle install (or bundle update if you’re updating an existing repo) to install the pre-release gems. Step 4: Install the Theme Add theme: \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\" to your _config.yml file. If you’re migrating from an existing Minimal Mistakes site you shouldn’t have to change anything else after this. If it’s a new site consult then docs to properly config. Please Note: Paths for image headers, overlays, teasers, galleries, and feature rows have changed and now require a full path. Instead of just image: filename.jpg you’ll need to use the full path eg: image: assets/images/filename.jpg. The preferred location is now assets/images but can be placed elsewhere or external hosted. This applies for image references in _config.yml and author.yml. Step 5: jekyll new Tweaks If this is a new site be sure to add the following files to _data/ and customize as you see fit. There is currently no way of bundling them in with the theme, so be sure to consult the docs on how to properly use both.   _data/ui-text.yml - UI text documentation  _data/navigation.yml - navigation documentationYou’ll also need to:   Replace &lt;site root&gt;/index.html with a modified Minimal Mistakes index.html.  Change layout: post in _posts/0000-00-00-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown to layout: single.  Remove about.md, or at the very least change layout: page to layout: single and remove references to icon-github.html (or copy to your _includes if using).That’s it! If all goes well running bundle exec jekyll serve should spin-up your site. If you encounter any bumps please file an issue on GitHub and make sure to indicate you’re testing the pre-release Ruby gem version. File an issue Thanks! ","categories": ["Jekyll"],

The traditional recipe combines a dough composed of butter and both brown and white sugar with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Variations include recipes with other types of chocolate as well as additional ingredients such as nuts or oatmeal. This recipe makes 4 dozen cookies. Ingredients   2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour  1 teaspoon baking soda  1/2 teaspoon salt  1 cup butter, softened and cut to pieces  1 cup sugar  1 cup light brown sugar, packed  2 teaspoons vanilla extract  2 large eggs  2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips  1/2 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)  1 cup chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)Directions   Preheat the oven to 350 F.  In a medium bowl, whisk flour with baking soda, nutmeg and salt.  In a large bowl, beat butter with sugar and brown sugar until creamy and light.
